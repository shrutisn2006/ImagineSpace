        text: "Far away, the Sun was very busy. Suddenly, it sent a big burst of light and tiny sparks toward Earth. “Oops! Here comes a surprise!” said the Sun. It didn’t mean to hurt anyone, but it was very strong.",
        animation: "sunburst",
      },
      {
        text: "The Sun’s bursts are called space weather. Space weather is like invisible wind and rain from the Sun, made of energy and tiny particles. It can reach Earth and sometimes make machines, satellites, and gadgets behave strangely—even Ravi’s soil helpers!",

      },
      {
        text: "Next morning, Ravi saw his gadgets blinking strangely. Some numbers were missing, and others were wrong. “Oh no! How will I know if the plants need water?” he worried. If he guessed wrong, the plants might get too dry or too wet.",
        animation: "gadgets-error",
      },
      {
        text: "Ravi remembered a tool he had: a space weather app. It got signals from satellites and warned farmers before storms from the Sun arrived. Ravi opened it and read: “Solar storm coming! Gadgets may not work properly.”",

      },
      {
        text: "Ravi used a simple stick and bucket to check the soil. He didn’t only rely on the gadgets. He also waited for the solar storm to pass. Slowly, he watered the plants carefully.",

      {
        text: "Ravi learned that the Sun can be surprising and strong. But smart thinking, simple tools, and technology together can solve big problems. Even big storms from space cannot stop us if we are careful, smart, and use our tools wisely.",

        text: "Families turned off extra lights and gadgets. Shops used backup batteries. Children watched the sky safely with their parents. Sam checked the power stations for safety.",

      {
        text: "A solar storm can disturb satellites in space. Satellites send signals for TV, GPS, and phones. When the storm hits, signals may break. Screens can go blank!",

      },

      {
        text: "One sunny afternoon, Asha was flying over the ocean. Suddenly, her radio started making strange noises: “ZZZZZT... crackle... ZZZZT!” She couldn’t hear ATC anymore. Her radio was blacked out!",
        animation: "radio-error",
      },
      {
        text: "Sometimes, the Sun sends extra energy that hits Earth’s upper air, called the ionosphere. This makes it hard for radio waves to travel through, causing them to get lost!",
